-Placeholders for concrete types
-Enables writing more reusable and flexible code
-Avoids having duplicate code for different types
-Zero cost abstraction, Rust compiler will at compile time fill out generics with concrete types

Const Generics

-Type parameter that represents a compile-time constant value
-Allows to write generic code that operates on values that are known at compile time
-Used for array sizes, bit widths and other constants
